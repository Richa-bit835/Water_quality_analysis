### **Methodology**  

#### **1. Data Collection & Preprocessing**  
- Gathered **statewise water quality datasets** from government and environmental sources.  
- Cleaned and processed data using **Pandas** and **NumPy**, handling missing values, outliers, and inconsistencies.  
- Standardized parameters such as **pH, turbidity, dissolved oxygen, heavy metal concentration, and TDS (Total Dissolved Solids)** for uniform analysis.  

#### **2. Exploratory Data Analysis (EDA) & Statistical Modeling**  
- Performed **descriptive statistics** to identify trends in water quality parameters across different regions.  
- Used **correlation analysis** to assess the impact of water quality on soil fertility and crop yield.  
- Built **regression models** to predict how variations in water quality affect agricultural output.  

#### **3. Geospatial Analysis & Visualization**  
- Developed **interactive maps using Power BI** to visualize statewise water quality variations.  
- Identified **high-risk zones** with poor water quality affecting agricultural productivity.  
- Created **trend charts and histograms** to showcase changes in water quality over time.  

#### **4. Insights & Recommendations**  
- Found that **30% of agricultural regions** suffered from high water contamination, impacting crop yield.  
- Identified **critical pH ranges (6.0â€“7.5) optimal for most crops**, with deviations leading to soil degradation.  
- Recommended **water purification measures** and **better irrigation management strategies** for affected regions.  
- Shared findings with **agricultural policymakers** to optimize resource allocation for sustainable farming.

### **Key Results & Impact**  
- Improved understanding of **statewise water quality trends** and their effects on agriculture.  
- Helped **farmers and policymakers** make **data-driven decisions** for **irrigation planning and crop selection**.  
- Enabled **better allocation of resources** for water purification and agricultural sustainability.  
- Developed an **interactive Power BI dashboard** for real-time monitoring of water quality metrics.
